<h1>Caution Sign Detection</h1>
This program takes a cution sign as input an tries to find out whether the sign is a valid caution sign or not.
<h2>How it works</h2>
Here we use OpenCV python ibrary and pytesseract to read alphabet letters form an image and this way we first can disscard of an image whether the image is a caution sign or not.<br>
<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
You need to install first tesseract and pytesseract and of course opencv to use the program without any issues.
