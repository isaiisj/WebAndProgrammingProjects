<h1>Project planner</h1>
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that is used to illustrate the schedule of a project. 
The tasks to be performed are listed on the y axis and the tie periods are listed on the x axis.
Horizontal bars on the graph display the duration of each activity.
<h2>How it works</h2>
This planner will create a schedule to help users plan their work. The program will display a window 
with a button that user can press to choose a project file. It will then read a list of tasks form the
file and sort them in the order of their starting time based on certain prerequisites. The resulting data 
will be converted into a chart that will display when each task starts and ends.
